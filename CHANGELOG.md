# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

The latest section is published verbatim as the GitHub Release notes by
`.github/workflows/release.yml` when a `vX.Y.Z` tag is pushed.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-06-21

### Added

- **👥 Contributors** — a contrib.rocks avatar wall plus "How to Contribute" and
  "Releasing a New Version" guidance in the README.
- **⭐ Top Contributors** — a curated table highlighting the people who shape the
  project.
- **📊 Stars** — a live star-history chart in the README.
- **🌍 StarMapper** — an interactive world map of the project's stargazers.
- **📦 Release automation** — `.github/workflows/release.yml` builds a clean,
  downloadable source zip and publishes a GitHub Release on every `v*.*.*` tag,
  using this CHANGELOG section as the release notes (auto-generated notes as a
  fallback).
- **🤖 Agent instructions** — a new `AGENTS.md` documenting the architecture,
  conventions, and the batched-PR → conflict-resolve → merge → release workflow.
- **📋 Release checklist** — `docs/ops/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md` codifies the
  pre-release validation steps.

### Changed

  workflow and how versioned releases are cut.
