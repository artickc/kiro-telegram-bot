A professional Telegram bridge for the **Agent Client Protocol (ACP)** that
turns Kiro CLI into a mobile, always-on AI pair programmer. Send a message from
anywhere and watch Kiro read files, run commands, and edit code on your machine
— with live typing indicators, clean Telegram markdown, and unified edit diffs.

Inspired by [`ajitnk-lab/kiro-acp-telegram-bot`](https://github.com/ajitnk-lab/kiro-acp-telegram-bot)
and extended into a full multi-session client.

## ✨ Features

| Capability | What it does |
|---|---|
| 🗂 **Projects** | `/projects` browses your folders and runs Kiro in the one you pick. |
| ♻️ **Resume sessions** | `/sessions` lists recent Kiro sessions; tap to resume via ACP `session/load`. |
| 🟢 **Connect to live sessions** | `/active` shows sessions running **right now** on your PC. Watch them live, or continue them — see below. |
| 📡 **Live watch** | Follow a running session read-only in real time (tails its event log). |
| 🧭 **Always-visible menu** | A persistent keyboard plus a pinned status panel that always shows your current **project, agent, reasoning effort, model, session and queue**. |
| ⏰ **Scheduled tasks** | Create prompts that run on a schedule (once / daily / weekly / monthly / every-N-minutes) in a chosen project, delivered back to your chat. |
| 🖼 **Multi-image prompts** | Send one or many photos (albums included) with a caption — all attached to the prompt for the agent to analyze. |
| 📜 **History** | `/history` shows the latest messages of any session. |
| ⌨️ **Typing indicator** | Stays on for the whole turn, even through long tool chains. |
| 📥 **Queued follow-ups** | Message while Kiro is busy — it's queued and runs next. `/btw` queues explicitly; `/flush` runs now. |
| ✏️ **Edit diffs** | File edits show as unified `diff` blocks with `+N -M` stats. |
| 💬 **Quality markdown** | Converts agent markdown to Telegram **MarkdownV2** with safe escaping and code-fence-aware splitting. |
| 🔁 **Self-healing** | Auto-restarts the Kiro agent with backoff and re-binds your session. |
| 🖥 **Runs 24/7** | 1-click install as a background service that starts on boot — Windows, Linux, macOS, auto-detected. |
| 🔒 **Access control** | Restrict to specific Telegram user IDs. |

## 🚀 1-click install

Clone or download, then run the installer for your OS. It installs
dependencies, auto-detects `kiro-cli`, writes `.env`, asks for your bot token,
and optionally sets up the background service.

**Windows** — double-click `install.cmd` (or in a terminal):

```powershell
.\install.cmd
```

**Linux / macOS**:

```bash
chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh
```

### Prerequisites

- **Kiro CLI** installed and authenticated — run `kiro-cli chat` once to confirm.
- **Node.js 20+**.
- A **bot token** from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).
- Your **Telegram user ID** from [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot).

---

## 🧑‍💻 Manual setup

```bash
npm install
npm run setup            # auto-detects kiro-cli + project roots, writes .env
# edit .env: set TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN and ALLOWED_USERS
npm start
```

No build step — TypeScript runs directly via `tsx`.

---

## 🛠 Run as a background service (daemon)

The bot installs as a **user-level** service that starts automatically on boot.
The platform is auto-detected:

| OS | Mechanism | Starts on |
|---|---|---|
| Windows | Hidden Scheduled Task | logon |
| Linux | systemd **user** service (+ linger) | boot |
| macOS | launchd LaunchAgent | login |

```bash
npm run install:service     # install + start, enable autostart
npm run service -- status   # show install + running state
npm run service -- stop
npm run service -- restart
npm run service -- logs 200 # tail the log file
npm run uninstall:service   # stop + remove
```

Or use the `kiro-tg` command (if linked): `kiro-tg install | status | logs`.

Logs are written to `logs/kiro-telegram-bot.log` (rotated at 5 MB).

/projects     List projects · /projects <q> search · /projects new <name>
/sessions     List & resume sessions (active first) · /sessions <q> to filter
/active       Sessions running now on the PC
/running      Sessions this chat controls — switch between them
/killall      Kill all active sessions on the PC (with confirm)
/tasks        Manage scheduled tasks
/newtask      Create a scheduled task (wizard)
/history      Show recent conversation history

```

Anything that isn't a command is sent to Kiro as a prompt. While a turn is
running, your messages are queued and sent automatically when it finishes.

---

## 🧭 The menu & status panel

A **persistent reply keyboard** sits under the message box with quick actions:
Project · Agent · Reasoning · Model · Sessions · Tasks · Status · New · Stop.

A **pinned status panel** at the top of the chat always shows your current
**project, agent, reasoning effort, model, session id, activity and queue**,
and updates live as things change. Tap **Agent**, **Reasoning** or **Model** to
change them from inline menus (reasoning steers how thoroughly the agent works:
Minimal → Max).

## ⏰ Scheduled tasks

A task is a **prompt + a project + a schedule**. When it fires, the bot opens a
session in that project, runs the prompt, and delivers the result to your chat.

- **/newtask** (or the ➕ button) launches a guided wizard: name → prompt →
  project → schedule → confirm.
- **Schedules**: `once` at a date/time, `daily` at HH:MM, `weekly` (e.g. `Mon 09:00`),
  `monthly` (e.g. `15 09:00`), or `interval` (every N minutes).
- **/tasks** lists everything with buttons to **run now, enable/disable, edit**
  (rename, prompt, project, reschedule) and **delete**.

Tasks are stored in `data/tasks.json` and survive restarts; the scheduler runs
them whether you're online or not (great with the 24/7 service).

## 🖼 Sending images

Send one or several photos — including a Telegram **album** — with an optional
caption. The bot downloads them and attaches them all to the prompt as image
content blocks, so the agent can analyze them together. Images sent while Kiro
is busy are queued with your next turn.

**Images come back too:** when the agent produces images during a turn (e.g.
takes screenshots while testing an app), the bot detects the freshly-written
files and sends them back to Telegram automatically (`SEND_AGENT_IMAGES`).

## 🎙 Sending voice

Send a voice note (or audio file) and the bot transcribes it and runs it as a
prompt. Configure any OpenAI/Whisper-compatible endpoint via `STT_API_URL` in
`.env`; leave `STT_LANGUAGE` blank for automatic detection (English, Russian,
Romanian/Moldovan, and ~100 more).

---

## 🧭 Working on several sessions at once

One chat can drive **multiple Kiro sessions** and switch between them. Start a
session (📁 Project / 🆕 New), and each becomes a "controlled" session. Tap
**🧭 Running** (or `/running`) to switch: the foreground session streams live
while the others keep working quietly. When you switch to a session you see its
recent context and **every message that arrived while you were away** (its
unread, recovered from the session log). Leave a task running in A, hop to B,
reply, and come back to A to read what it did. Close a session with ✖ (it isn't
killed — see `/killall` for that).

## 🔗 Connecting to live sessions

Kiro keeps an **exclusive lock** on a session while it's running, so a second
client cannot hijack a session that's open in another window. This bot handles
that honestly:

- **📡 Watch** — follow the running session's output live (read-only) by tailing
  its event log. Stop with `/unwatch`.
- **Continue (fork)** — tapping a live session opens a **linked continuation** in
  the same project, primed with the recent transcript, so you can keep
  interacting from Telegram without disturbing the original.

Resuming an **idle** session loads it directly so you continue the exact thread.

## 🧩 How it works

```
Telegram  ──HTTPS──▶  Bot (grammY)
                         │  spawns once
                         ▼
                 kiro-cli acp  ◀── JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio ──▶  Bot
                         │
                         ├─ session/new / session/load   (projects, resume)
                         ├─ session/prompt               (your messages)
                         └─ session/update notifications (streamed text, tools)
```

One `kiro-cli acp` process multiplexes many sessions (one per chat/project).
Streamed `agent_message_chunk` updates are assembled into a live, throttled
message; `tool_call` updates render as professional status lines with diffs.

Kiro persists sessions to `~/.kiro/sessions/cli/`:
`<id>.json` (metadata), `<id>.jsonl` (history, used by `/history` and live
watch), and `<id>.lock` (`{ pid }`, used to detect active sessions).

## ❓ FAQ

**Can I run the Kiro Telegram bot 24/7 on a server?** Yes — `npm run install:service`
installs a user-level service (systemd/launchd/Scheduled Task) that starts on
boot and auto-restarts on crash.

**How do I control Kiro from my phone?** Set up the bot, message it on Telegram,
and pick a project with `/projects`. Every message becomes a Kiro prompt.

**Can multiple people use one bot?** Add their IDs to `ALLOWED_USERS`. Each chat
gets its own session.

**Why can't I take over a session that's already running?** Kiro locks active
sessions exclusively. The bot lets you **watch** it live or **fork** a linked
continuation instead. See "Connecting to live sessions".

**Does it support custom agents and MCP servers?** Yes — set `KIRO_AGENT`, and
the bot inherits whatever MCP servers Kiro CLI is configured with.

---

## 🔐 Inline approvals

The bot implements ACP `session/request_permission`: when Kiro asks the client
to approve a risky tool call, it appears in Telegram with **Approve / Approve
always / Deny** buttons and your choice is sent back (unanswered prompts time
out and are denied).

> Note: Kiro CLI 2.8.1 resolves tool permissions internally (via
> `~/.kiro/settings/permissions.yaml` and agent config) and does **not** yet
> delegate them over ACP, so these prompts stay dormant on current Kiro. The
> wiring is forward-compatible and activates automatically when Kiro emits
> permission requests. Today, use the live tool stream + **⏹ Stop** to
> intervene, and `permissions.yaml` to govern what Kiro may do.

## 🔐 Security

This bot lets authorized Telegram users run commands and edit files on the host.
**Always set `ALLOWED_USERS`**, keep `.env` private, and run as a non-privileged
user. See [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) for the full model.
